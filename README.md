# DELVE Research 2026: Swarm-Based Adversarial Intelligence

This repository serves as a research hub for exploring **Decentralized Generative Architectures**. We focus on replacing traditional, monolithic neural networks with **Swarm-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** operating within adversarial frameworks.

## 🔬 Theoretical Core

Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) rely on global weight updates via backpropagation. Our research explores a shift toward **Stigmergic Coordination**, where emergent intelligence arises from the local interactions of thousands of simple agents navigating a data manifold.

## 🛠 Key Conceptual Frameworks

### 1. Swarm Adversarial Systems (SAS / GAS)

The foundational concept of utilizing **Generative Agent Swarms (GAS)**. Instead of a single generator network, a population of agents "forages" the latent space to synthesize data that can bypass a competing discriminator swarm.

### 2. Swarm Adversarial Collective (SAC)

A model focusing on the **collective intelligence** of agent populations. SAC emphasizes the transition from rigid digital neurons to fluid, dynamic agent groups that can reorganize their topology in real-time.

### 3. Adversarial Multi-Agent Foraging (AMAF)

An optimization strategy rooted in biology. AMAF treats the search for the "optimal data distribution" as a resource-gathering exercise, where agents use pheromone-like traces (gradients) to find high-fidelity regions of the manifold.

### 4. Distributed Agent Minimax (DAM)

The mathematical backbone of our research. DAM adapts the [minimax game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to a distributed setting, ensuring stability between competing swarms without the need for a central orchestrator.

### 5. Stigmergic Adversarial Network (SAN)

A framework where coordination is achieved through **environmental modification**. Agents do not communicate directly; they "smell" the loss function left behind by the discriminator, allowing for massive scalability and decentralization.

## 🚀 Practical Implications

* **Interpretability:** Unlike "black box" neural layers, swarm dynamics allow for the direct visualization of mode collapse and training instability as physical spatial clusters of agents.
* **Dynamic Data Adaptation (DDA):** These systems are designed for continuous learning environments. Swarms can adapt to shifting data streams in real-time by spawning or culling agents, making them ideal for [Self-Correcting Digital Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin).
* **Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI):** Integrating human intuition into the swarm's search loop. CSI allows researchers to act as "meta-agents," subtly guiding the swarm toward specific creative or technical goals.

## 📈 Next Steps

Our current priority is the development of a **Unified Agent-Manifold Interface**. This software framework will translate traditional loss functions into "navigational currents" that agents can perceive and follow using local heuristic rules.

Demos of the algorithms are posted in this [X thread](https://x.com/izzyz/status/2007150229544677758.
